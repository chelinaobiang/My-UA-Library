/**
 * The MyLibraryController class manages a few of the operations for a library system,
 * interacting with the Model and handling functionalities related to books in the library.
 *
 * Attributes:
 * - satisfied (boolean): Indicates whether the user is satisfied with the library commands.
 * - model (MyLibraryModel): The model that represents the library's data.
 * - book (Book): A temporary Book object used for recommendations or additions.
 * - input (Scanner): A Scanner for user input from the console for interactions.
 *
 * Methods:
 * - isSatisfied: Returns the current satisfaction status of the user.
 * - setSatisfaction: Sets the satisfaction status to true to end program.
 * - getAllUnreadBooks: Returns a sorted list of all unread books in the library.
 * - getAllreadBooks: Returns a sorted list of all read books in the library.
 * - suggestRead: Suggests a random unread book from the library.
 * - addBooks: Adds books to the library from a specified text file, skipping headers
 *   and parsing each book's title and author gathered from each line.
 *
